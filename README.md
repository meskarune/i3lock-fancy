no3lock-fancy
============

This is an i3lock bash script that takes a screenshot of the desktop, blurs the background and adds a No-meme icon :)
I removed all the other icons and features I don't use (grayscale, etc).

This is a fork of i3lock-fancy:

Multiple Monitors
-----------------
There is a branch called dual monitor with support for multiple monitors. This
branch uses a grey icon and text with outlines to make it visible on light and
dark backgrounds (though it looks better on dark backgrounds).
