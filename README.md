        -g, --greyscale  Set background to greyscale instead of color.
        -p, --pixelate   Pixelate the background instead of blur, runs faster.

Extras
------

### The lock screen in action

![lockscreen animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy/master/action.gif)

Use this with xautolock to automatically lock the screen after a set time.

### Systemd Unit file

Edit for your own use.

    [Unit]
    Description=Lock the screen automatically after a timeout

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=meskarune
    Environment=DISPLAY=:0
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/xautolock -time 5 -locker /usr/local/bin/lock/lock -detectsleep

    [Install]
    WantedBy=graphical.target

### When using a run dialog (Rofi, dmenu)
When using a run dialog to lock the screen, the dialog ends up in the
background screenshot. To avoid this, specify a delay before taking the
screenshot by using the `-s|--screenshot-delay` option.

Multiple Monitors
-----------------
There is a branch called dual monitor with support for multiple monitors. This
branch uses a grey icon and text with outlines to make it visible on light and
dark backgrounds (though it looks better on dark backgrounds). I am still
working to get it looking just right right. The script is usable now, but it's
under developement and things may change.
