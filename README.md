i3lock-fancy
============

i3lock script that takes desktop screenshot, blurs and darken the background and adds a lock icon and text. I modified the original script (by [meskarune](https://github.com/meskarune)): this version can accept a custom text as an input, if no text is provided it applies the default "type password to unlock".

Update: New version uses ffmpeg instead of scrot and imagemagick. Thanks to [/u/edijatszik](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/4yj29e/i3lock_simple_blur_script/) [Github link](https://github.com/petvas/i3lock-blur) the way I darken the background is a bit cheaty but it works. There is probably a better way.

Depends:
* [i3lock-color-git](https://github.com/eBrnd/i3lock-color)
* ffmpeg
* Digital Tech font (included)
