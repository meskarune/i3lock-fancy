Usage
-----

    i3lock-fancy [options]
    
    Options:
        -h, --help       This help menu.
    
        -d, --desktop    Attempt to minimize all windows before locking. Requires wmctrl.
    
        -g, --greyscale  Set background to greyscale instead of color.
    
        -p, --pixelate   Pixelate the background instead of blur, runs faster.
    
        -f <fontname>, --font <fontname>  Set a custom font.
    
        -t <text>, --text <text> Set a custom text prompt.

        -l, --listfonts  Display a list of possible fonts for use with -f/--font.
                         Note: this option will not lock the screen, it displays
                         the list and exits immediately.

        -n, --nofork     Do not fork i3lock after starting.
    
        --               Must be last option. Set command to use for taking a
                         screenshot. Default is 'import -window root'. Using 'scrot'
                         or 'maim' will increase script speed and allow setting
                         custom flags like haing a delay.

example: ```i3lock-fancy -gpf Comic-Sans-MS -- scrot -z```

Extras
------

The lock screen in action:

![lockscreen animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy/master/action.gif)

To use this script you can set a hotkey in your window manager to run the lock command,
set xautolock to run at boot, or use a systemd script to either lock on suspend or run xautolock.

xautolock is a utility to automatically lock the screen after a set time. It also 
supports hot corners.

Systemd Unit file example (edit for your own use):

    [Unit]
    Description=Lock the screen automatically after a timeout
    
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=meskarune
    Environment=DISPLAY=:0
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/xautolock -time 5 -locker /usr/bin/i3lock-fancy -detectsleep
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=graphical.target

Multiple Monitors
-----------------
There is a branch called dual monitor with support for multiple monitors. 
(it is currently out of date compared to the main locker, I need to update 
it with all the new features) This branch uses a grey icon and text with 
outlines to make it visible on light and dark backgrounds (though it looks 
better on dark backgrounds). I am still working to get it looking just right 
right. The script is usable now, but it's under developement and things may change.

Static image
------------
If you would like to run `i3lock-color` with a static image in the style of
i3lock-fancy, run `convert` from image magick directly on the background image
you want to use. Then specify the result `newimage.png` to `i3lock -i`:
```
#!/bin/sh
# Add a lock icon and text to the center of an image
convert /path/to/background.png -font Liberation-Sans \
    -pointsize 26 -fill white -gravity center \
    -annotate +0+160 "Type Password to Unlock" lock.png \
    -gravity center -composite newimage.png
```

```
i3lock -i newimage.png
```
