i3lock-fancy
============

i3lock script that takes a screenshot of the desktop, blurs the background and adds a lock icon and text.

New features in this fork:
 - script checks the brightness of screen, and shows differently colored text and i3lock circle depending on it.
 - 8 bit fonts, if your system already supports them.
 - the picture of an extremely photogenic cat instead of a padlock icon.

Depends:
* [i3lock-color-git](https://github.com/eBrnd/i3lock-color)
* imagemagick
* scrot
* bitmap font support and artwiz fonts - http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=196047 - you can replace with an available font of your choice
